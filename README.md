## Restful API Development Challenge
 This repository contains the code for my backend API development challenge. I've created a RESTful API using Node.js, JavaScript, MongoDB for database storage, and JWT token-based authentication.

## About Me
Hi, I'm Sudhakar Mirjeli, passionate about backend development and have designed this API to meet the requirements of the challenge while also implementing best practices and security measures.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- JavaScript
- MongoDB

## Authentication
The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. It employs a token-based authentication system for securing endpoints and authorizing access to protected resources.

## Database
This project utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for data storage. MongoDB provides flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for handling diverse data types and scaling as the application grows.

## Installation
To run the project locally:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up your MongoDB database.
4. Configure environment variables for JWT secret, MongoDB connection string, etc.
5. Run the application using `npm start`.

## Usage
- Use POSTman or any API testing tool to interact with the API endpoints.
- Register users, authenticate with JWT tokens, and access protected routes as specified in the API documentation.

## Folder Structure
- `/controllers`: Contains logic handling incoming requests and producing responses.
- `/models`: Defines MongoDB data models and schemas.
- `/routes`: Defines API routes and endpoints.
- `/middleware`: Contains middleware functions for authentication, error handling, etc.
- `/config`: Configuration files, environment variables, etc.
